Lane Keeping:
    DONE:
        clear out lane detection folder
        move tmp.py to lane detection folder
        set up named pipes
        change named pipes from hardcoded to include
        put forking functions into main.cpp
    IN PROGRESS:
        add filter to lane detection (exists on Jetson #2)
    TODO:
        Resolve index out of bounds error
        Fix point drawing to come AFTER filter, not BEFORE!
        Don't add filter when first finding. That means the later check will never trigger. During search, add to tmp
            then at end do check with previously added data. Now it can trigger.
        fork off gpio and lane detection
        Use OTSU with filter
        read only most recent value
        check execs using pipes to watch how many processes succeeded vs failed
        Get manual control over camera to prevent from autofocusing on random stuff (Control brightness, iso, aperture, etc?)
        testing

PID:
    DONE:
    TODO:
        Make object that can be instantiated in processes that want a PID controller.
        Slow vehicle if turning

Object Detection:
    DONE:
    TODO:
        YOLO? ImageAI?
        Can we use pretrained datasets considering this is small-scale and we have different obstacles?

GPIO:
    DONE:
    TODO:
        hardware pwm
        Run motor off arduino

i2c:
    DONE:
    TODO:
        Fix read buff where reading 10+numBytes...should try reading just numBytes. (see laneDetectionController)
        Why does it keep reading after laneDetection is ctrl-c'ed? Please fix that.

laneDetectionController:
    DONE:
    TODO:
        Fix read buff where reading 10+numBytes...should try reading just numBytes. (see i2c)
        Need to init steering to straight
        Add drip instead of integrator


Misc:
    DONE:
    IN PROGRESS:
        Save video locally (need new video drivers?)
    TODO:
        Set up kill signals to gracefully end children
            Can try using polling stdin for q
        Is something messing with WiFi preventing ssh in, or cutting it?
        Dead man switch should kill if ssh signal is lost (see DeBruhl Slack)
